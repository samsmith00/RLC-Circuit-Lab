# RLC Circuit Lab for Differential Equations Course  
Final Project for MATH 221: Differential Equations  
This project demonstrates concepts such as linear systems, straight-line solutions, phase portraits, complex eigenvalues, and second-order linear equations using RLC circuits as a case study. 

## Methodology  
This project combines handwritten solutions with Python visualizations to ensure a thorough understanding of the material.  
- **Problem-Solving:** Each problem was solved analytically on paper before being translated into Python.  
- **Visualization:** The Manim Python library was used to create animations to explain concepts and demonstrate solutions visually.  
- **Topics Covered:** The animations delve into sub-topics like damping behavior (underdamped, overdamped, critically damped) and showcase the dynamics of RLC circuits through phase portraits and eigenvalue analysis.
