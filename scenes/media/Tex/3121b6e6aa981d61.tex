Question 1
                    
                         First, set the input voltage to zero, that is, assume $v_T = 0$. Using the three equations
                        above, write a first-order system of differential equations with dependent variables $i$
                        and $v_C$. [Hint: Use the first equation to eliminate $v_L$ from the third equation. You
                        should have $R, C,$ and $L$ as parameters in your system.]
