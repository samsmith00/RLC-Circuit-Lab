                    Since $R > 0$, the phase portrait spirals clockwise toward the orgin. This indicates
                    that the system is underdamped and both $v_C$ (voltage) and $i$ (current) oscillate 
                    while they gradually decay, enventually approaching $(0,0)$ in the phase portrait.
                    Lastly, we can create our general solution equation by plugging our values into the 
                    equation:
